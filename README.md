# super-rentals

This repository contains my code for the super-rentals tutorial on the ember website.  I set it up to try a few things out with Ember, such as getting mirage-cli up and running and setting up a rails-api backend.  This is in no way an official implementation and has nothing to do with the Ember site, this is just my notes and code.  I made it public since it might be useful.

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

If you want to run this with the rails backend, 
*checkout super-rentals-api and start the rails app. 
* start the ember app with `ember serve --env=proxy --proxy=http://localhost:3000`
